            <p>Before reading, it is necessary to watch this video:

            <br><p id="explanation">Big O is basically a measure of an algorithim's complexity in terms of N. It has nothing to do with the hardware running the code. It can be looked at 
            in worst-case, best-case, and average-case, but you'll only be needing to learn worst-case. Two things to note about Big O are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Big O ignores constants. For instance, 5n is written as O(n)</li>
                <li>Higher order terms take precedence over lower terms. The highest order term is the complexity of the code.
                    <ul>
                        <li>O(n!)</li>
                        <li>O(2ⁿ)</li>
                        <li>O(nˣ)</li>
                        <li>O(nlogn)</li>
                        <li>O(n)</li>
                        <li>O(logn)</li>
                        <li>O(1)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Let's take a look at what these different terms mean.</p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="O(1)">O(1)</h2>

            <p>O(1), or constant complexity, means that the program has a constant time regardless of the data set size. They are efficient with any data set.
            Take this code for example:</p>

            <pre><code>int i = 3;
System.out.println(i);</code></pre>

            <p>No matter how big the int we print, or how many print statements we have, the input never changes the execution time. Therefore, it is O(1).</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2 id="O(logn)">O(logn)</h2>

            <p>O(logn), or logarithmic complexity, means that the amount of data an algorithm has is halved each time it runs, or passes. They are efficient with large data sets.
            This can be very easily visualized with a binary search tree.</p>

            <img src="/images/binary search tree.png" alt="Image of a binary search tree" class="responsive">

            <p>Each time you branch off from one number to another and proceed down the tree, you are halving your data set. Binary search trees are not the only
            algorithms with logn complexities. Another example, shockingly, is a logarithm.
            <br>In order to this next example, we must first understand what a log is. A log is the exponent
            or power to which another number needs to be raised to yield a certain number. In computer science, it is assumed that the base of a log is 2, so 
            let's say we need to find x when log₂8=x. This problem is asking for the exponent that needs to be applied on 2 to equal 8 
            which can be rewritten as 2ˣ=8. With this in mind, let's take a look at this code:</p>

            <pre><code>import static java.lang.System.*;
public class test{
    public static void main (String[] args){
        double n = 8.0;
        out.println(log(n));
    }
    public static double log(double n){
        if(n == 0){
            return n;
        } 
        n=Math.floor(n/2);
        return log(n);
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>In the program, the main method asks to print out log(8). The method first checks to see if the input is equal to 0 and simply returns 0 if it is.
            If it isn't, it divides n by 2, and then rounds it down to avoid dealing with decimals. Finally, it calls itself again in what is known as a recursion
            and the process is repeated until 0 is reached. Notice that this program runs 3 times before returning 0 which is the answer to the problem we discussed earlier.
            This code also has a complexity of O(logn) because the data set is halved every pass.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="O(n)">O(n)</h2>

            <p>O(n), or linear complexity, means that the complexity of your code is directly proportional to the size of your input. Take this code for example:</p>
            
            <pre><code>import static java.lang.System.*;
public class test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        int[] array = new int[10];
        for(int i = 0; i&ltarray.length; i++){
            array[i] = i;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i&ltarray.length; i++){
            out.println(array[i]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>This code takes an array of length 10, sets every number as its index, then prints out the numbers individually. Notice that the amount
                of times the loops run is directly controlled by the length of the array, therefore giving this code a complexity of O(n).
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="O(nlogn)">O(nlogn)</h2>

            <p>O(nlogn), or loglinear complexity, means that your program has logn complexity n times. Notice how the word loglinear is just log and linear put together. This is because
                O(nlogn) is essentially the blending of O(n) and O(logn). Let's take a look
                at some code:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code>import static java.lang.System.*;
public class test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        double n = 4, y = n;
        while(n>1){ //complexity of this loop is O(logn)
            n = Math.floor(n/2);
            for(int i = 1; i<=y; i++){ //complexity of this loop is O(n)
                out.println(i);
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>In this program, you can see that the outer loop is O(logn) because the outer loop halves the data set upon every iteration. The
                inner loop is O(n) because the for loop is directly dependent on the input size of y. You might be wondering, why isn't this code
                just O(n)? After all, you said earlier that in Big O we take the highest order term. While this is true, it isn't always the case.
                The reason why this program is an exception to that rule is because the inner for loop is nested inside of the while loop. When
                we have nested loops, we multiply both of the loops' complexities. If the
                for loop was separate from the while loop, you would choose O(n) because it is the highest order term. Since the for loop can only
                run as many times as the while loop, you have to combine them. This leads to the program having a complexity of O(nlogn).
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 id="O(n^x)">O(nˣ)</h2>

            <p>O(nˣ), or polynomial complexity, means that your code will run through all of n for every n x number of times.
                X represents the number of times all of n will be processed for every n. Take this code for example:
            </p>

            <pre><code>import static java.lang.System.*;
public class test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
        int n = 5;
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i&ltn; i++){ //complexity is O(n)
            for(int j = 0; j&ltn; j++){ //complexity is also O(n)
                out.println(++count);
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Both for loops have complexities of O(n). However, as we previously stated, nested for loops mean that you have to multiply the terms,
                rather than take the highest order term. This means this program has a complexity of O(n²), which is really O(nˣ) since we drop constants.
            </p>
